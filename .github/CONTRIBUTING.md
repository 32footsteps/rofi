# Creating an issue

When reporting bugs keep in mind that the people working on it do this unpaid, in their free time and as a hobby. So be
polite and helpful. Bug reports that demand, contain insults to this or other projects, or have a general unfriendly
tone will be closed without discussion. Keep in mind that everybody has it own way of working; What might be the norm
for you, might not be for others. Therefore be verbose in your description.

Before creating an issue:

* Update to the latest version. Check if problem still exists.
* Check existing bug reports, see if it is already reported.
* Read the documentation. Make sure the behaviour you are seeing is a bug.

When reporting bugs include the following information:

* Rofi version. rofi -v
* Rofi configuration. rofi -dump-xresources (preferable in a pastebin)
* Steps to reproduce.
* What behaviour you see.
* What behaviour you expect to see.
* A proper title for others to search for.
* Be exact.

The issue tracker is not for:

* Questions. 
* Writing complaints.

Questions will be marked `question` and closed. If the question is clear, I normally try to provide an answer.
