# V1.4.0: I reject your truth and trumpstitute my own

> This release contains some major changes. One of them being a new theme engine. The migration from older versions
> to this version might not go flawless. 

With more then 700 commits since the last version, this is one of the biggest releases so far.
In this version we used the groundwork laid in v1.3.0 and went completely nuts. This release should satisfy the die-hard
desktop [ricers](https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/) with a brand new, CSS based, theme engine.

The great work of [SardemFF7](https://github.com/SardemFF7/) simplified the code base and improved the key and mouse
handling. It also made it possible to add a often requested feature of icons (correctly using the icon-theme). A feature
I never expected to be added.

A last big addition, is support for plugins. Allowing the addition of some weird/fancy features. Currently two plugins
are available, [blezz](https://gitcrate.org/qtools/rofi-blezz) a quick launch menu with it own menu definition and
[top](https://gitcrate.org/qtools/rofi-top/) displaying running processes.

Beside these major changes, this release includes a lot of bug-fixes and small improvements. See the bottom of this
release notes for the full list of changes.
