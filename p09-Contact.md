# Reporting Bugs

When reporting bugs keep in mind that the people working on it do this unpaid, in their free time
and as a hobby. So be polite and helpful. Bug reports that *demand*, contain *insults* to this
or other projects, or have a general unfriendly tone will be closed without discussion. Keep in mind
that everybody has it own way of working; What might be the *norm* for you, might not be for others.
